Once upon a time there was a cat named Quimby. Quimby was an adorable little grey tabby who thoroughly enjoyed getting lots of attention. One day, Quimby's owner started spending absurd amounts of time sitting in front of a computer, and that seriously cut into Quimby's attention-getting. Quimby decided that drastic action was required.

Quimby's first course of action was to initiate "Operation: Cute AF." She sat next to the computer desk, and looked as cute as she could possibly look. It worked, but only for a brief second.
